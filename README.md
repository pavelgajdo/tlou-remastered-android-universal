# The Last of Us Remastered — Daedalus Android

An Android adaptation of the PS4 **The Last of Us Remastered**, based on
[ravencaio's PC port](https://github.com/ravencaio/tlou-remastered-pc).
The game runs through an ARM64 Bionic runtime, FEX CPU translation and Vulkan rendering.

**Version 0.1.1 · Android release update**

## What is included

- TLOU-themed launcher and app icon; automatic game preparation on the phone.
- Installation from PKG or selection of an extracted game folder.
- Touch controls and physical controller support; in-game menu opened by swiping
  from the left edge toward the right.
- Fullscreen display modes that can be changed while playing.
- Compact single-line FPS/GPU/CPU overlay, with position and visibility settings.
- Original rendering resolution plus 720p, 540p and 360p patches; optional SSAO,
  motion blur, depth of field, bloom, sunlight-shadow and subsurface patches.
- 30 or 60 FPS limit and VSync settings. Actual performance depends on the scene
  and device; the 60 FPS limit is not a performance guarantee.
- Bundled Vulkan drivers and driver import from ZIP or SO files.
- Save import/export as ZIP, plus an in-game save selector with actual slot
  metadata and thumbnails when supplied by the game.
- App interface in Brazilian Portuguese, English, Spanish, French, German,
  Italian, Turkish, Polish, Russian and Hindi. The system language is selected
  automatically, with English as fallback; game language is selected inside the game.
- Log viewing and ZIP export for troubleshooting.

The tested performance settings are applied internally. Experimental benchmark
switches are not exposed in the public interface.

## Requirements and supported game

- **Android 11 or later**, with a 64-bit ARM Android environment and Vulkan support.
- Your own PS4 game dump. Recognized executable profiles include **01.00** and
  **01.11**. Patches are selected by validated executable SHA-256, not by
  CUSA alone.
- **CUSA00552** is the primary reference; recognized regional IDs such as
  CUSA00556 must use a known, supported executable. A title ID alone does not
  establish patch compatibility.
- Enough storage for the extracted game. PKG installation also needs room for
  extraction while the original package is present.

Android testing includes Redmagic 10 Pro and 11 Pro. Results vary by device,
scene and system configuration. PC benchmarks do not predict Android FPS.

### Bundled driver selection

| GPU family | Default bundled driver |
| --- | --- |
| Adreno 8xx | Turnip Gen8 V39 Patched |
| Adreno 7xx / 6xx | Turnip 27.0.0 R2 |

Driver selection/import remains available in settings. These defaults do not
constitute validation of every GPU in those families.

## Installation

1. Install the APK from the project distribution. To update a previous compatible
   build, install over it to retain app data and saves.
2. Grant the requested file access, then choose the extracted game folder or
   install your PKG from the launcher.
3. Let automatic preparation finish and select **Play**.
4. Adjust resolution, patches and controls as needed. Swipe right from the left
   edge during gameplay to open the menu.

Use the app's save export before uninstalling or clearing its data.

## Status of version 0.1.1

This update improves UI polish and update handling; gameplay has been demonstrated
on Android, but a complete playthrough and universal compatibility are not claimed.

- Shader compilation can cause pauses, especially on first visits to an area.
- Selective physics-result synchronization addresses the reported character
  deformation while keeping **Readback 1**. Readback 2 is not used by this build.
- A bounds guard prevents the identified static ray-hit path from accessing an
  invalid submesh. It preserves valid hits and skips the invalid result; the
  latest guard passed automated tests but still needs confirmation on the
  previously crashing device route.
- Other scene-specific graphics, collision or stability issues may remain.

For a bug report, export logs through **About → Export logs ZIP**, describe the
scene and steps, and specify whether the problem belongs to the current or
previous execution. Include the device, GPU, driver, game version and settings.

## Development

The Android implementation and verified build workflow are in the
[Android source tree](https://github.com/erickmendes22/tlou-remastered-android/tree/tlou-ui-approval-log32-20261105). See the [Android build guide](android/README.md).
The repository's historical Windows code remains available; it is not the APK
build procedure. Documentation changes alone do not require generating an APK.
